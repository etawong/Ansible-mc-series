**Setting up remote ansible server**
1. In vscode, make sure the "remote-SSH" and "Remote Development" extensions are installed.  
2. Configure remote ssh on vscode with user as ubuntu
    
   a. Click on settings, --> Command Palette, and type or select *"Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration file"*,  
   then select *C:\users\username\.ssh\config*
   
   b. In the ansible configuration file, do the following:
```
    Host "alias name"
        HostName ansible_server_IP
        User ubuntu #(default ubuntu user)
        IdentityFile path/to/private_key.pem
 ```

   Example:
   
```
    #Ansible host
    Host ansible
        HostName 52.53.241.79
        User ubuntu
        IdentityFile D:/ansible-key/ansible-key.pem!
```

	Then close the file.  
 
        If you're using windows, make sure you disable inheritance on the private key file,  
        and also make sure you are the only user that can read and write to the file. 
		速 Locate the file in Windows Explorer, right-click on it and select Properties.
		速 Navigate to the Security tab and click Advanced.
		速 Change the owner to yourself, disable inheritance and delete all permissions.
            	速 Then grant yourself red and write access, and save the changes.  
	      
c. Again, go to settings, --> Command Palette, and type or select "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host"  
        and then, select the host alias that you gave to the configuration file.  
        In the above example, host alias is ansible. 
   
3. Log into the remote server as ubuntu and switch user to ansible

        $ sudo su - ansible
4. Create .ssh directory in the home of ansible
   
        $ sudo mkdir .ssh
        $ sudo chown -R ansible:ansible .ssh
5. Copy the authorized keys from the home of ubuntu to the home of ansible
  - cd into the .ssh directory and run the command below.

        $ sudo cp /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys .

  - Change ownership of the key to ansible

         $ sudo chown ansible:ansible authorized_keys
6. Also change the ownership of /etc/ansible from root to ansible

        $ sudo chown -R ansible:ansible /etc/ansible
7. Now change the default user in the vscode config to log in as ansible
```
Host Ansible
    HostName 54.183.22.101
    User ansible
    IdentityFile ~/Downloads/ansible-key.pem
```

8. You can use the script below to install vscode on ubuntu using the script below.
```   
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget -y
   wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main" -y
   sudo apt install code -y
```
